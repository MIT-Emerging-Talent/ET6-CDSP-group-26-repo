# 📌 Retrospective — Data Analysis

## 🔴 Stop Doing

- Delaying analysis until all datasets are “perfect.”
- Trying to fit every dataset into one uniform structure.

## 🟢 Continue Doing

- Iteratively cleaning and aligning data rather than waiting for a final version.
- Using the survey as a key lens for interpreting quantitative trends.
- Applying both statistical and descriptive methods.

## 🟡 Start Doing

- Running exploratory analysis earlier to identify mismatches.
- Creating automated checks for missing or inconsistent values.

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- Analysis often reveals flaws in collection — flexibility is essential.
- Visualizations help clarify findings even when data is imperfect.
- Solo analysis work requires extra validation to avoid oversight.

## 👤 Individual Retrospective — Sahar Omer

In the data analysis phase, I focused on building the strongest possible logic
to test the hypothesis with the limited modeling knowledge I had. Most of the
effort went into deciding how to structure comparisons, identify exceptions, and
ensure the results truly reflected the data. I explored different approaches,
looked for patterns that could challenge or support the hypothesis, and refined
the analysis until it was as clear and defensible as possible. This phase
reinforced that careful reasoning and adaptability matter as much as technical skill.

### 🔴 Stop

- Trying to fit all datasets into one perfect structure.

### 🟢 Continue

- Stress-testing logic behind comparisons and models.

### 🟡 Start

- Documenting reasoning steps as I go to save time later.

## 👤 Individual Retrospective — Raghad Abdalrahim

This milestone taught me that good analysis means asking the right questions, not
using complex tools. I learned to embrace uncertainty and communicate limitations
clearly — both technical and human aspects of data.  

**Key lesson:** "How could this be wrong?" is the most important question.  

**Next time:** Validate data earlier and master Git tags. Simple, thoughtful
analysis often tells the truest stories.

## 👤 Individual Retrospective — Nagham Al Baba

This milestone taught me that clarity beats complexity. I realized that
understanding the context of data is more important than fancy tools. I also
learned to acknowledge assumptions and be transparent about uncertainties.  

**Key lesson:** Don’t give up when you feel lost; there’s always a solution.  

**Next time:** Focus on cleaning and exploring data. Thoughtful, simple analysis
often reveals the clearest stories.
