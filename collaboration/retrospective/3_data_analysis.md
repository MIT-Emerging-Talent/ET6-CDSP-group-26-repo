# 📌 Retrospective — Data Analysis

## 🔴 Stop Doing

- Delaying analysis until all datasets are “perfect.”
- Trying to fit every dataset into one uniform structure.

## 🟢 Continue Doing

- Iteratively cleaning and aligning data rather than waiting for a final version.
- Using the survey as a key lens for interpreting quantitative trends.
- Applying both statistical and descriptive methods.

## 🟡 Start Doing

- Running exploratory analysis earlier to identify mismatches.
- Creating automated checks for missing or inconsistent values.

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- Analysis often reveals flaws in collection — flexibility is essential.
- Visualizations help clarify findings even when data is imperfect.
- Solo analysis work requires extra validation to avoid oversight.

## 👤 Individual Retrospective — Sahar Omer

In the data analysis phase, I focused on building the strongest possible logic
to test the hypothesis with the limited modeling knowledge I had. Most of the
effort went into deciding how to structure comparisons, identify exceptions, and
ensure the results truly reflected the data. I explored different approaches,
looked for patterns that could challenge or support the hypothesis, and refined
the analysis until it was as clear and defensible as possible. This phase
reinforced that careful reasoning and adaptability matter as much as technical skill.

### 🔴 Stop

- Trying to fit all datasets into one perfect structure.

### 🟢 Continue

- Stress-testing logic behind comparisons and models.

### 🟡 Start

- Documenting reasoning steps as I go to save time later.
