# 📌 Retrospective — Data Analysis

## 🔴 Stop Doing

- Delaying analysis until all datasets are “perfect.”
- Trying to fit every dataset into one uniform structure.

## 🟢 Continue Doing

- Iteratively cleaning and aligning data rather than waiting for a final version.
- Using the survey as a key lens for interpreting quantitative trends.
- Applying both statistical and descriptive methods.

## 🟡 Start Doing

- Running exploratory analysis earlier to identify mismatches.
- Creating automated checks for missing or inconsistent values.

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- Analysis often reveals flaws in collection — flexibility is essential.
- Visualizations help clarify findings even when data is imperfect.
- Solo analysis work requires extra validation to avoid oversight.
