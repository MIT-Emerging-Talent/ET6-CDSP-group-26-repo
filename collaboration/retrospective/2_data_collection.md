# 📌 Retrospective

## 🔴 Stop Doing

- Relying on team members to complete documentation without setting clear
expectations or deadlines  
- Delaying or skipping weekly meetings  

## 🟢 Continue Doing

- Holding weekly check-ins to align tasks and clarify roles  
- Combining different types of data (event-based, behavioral, and survey-based)
- to get a more comprehensive view  
- Rethinking the same question until we find a way to measure it — not taking
- “no” for an answer  
- Supporting each other in areas where one teammate had more experience  

## 🟡 Start Doing

- Assigning backup owners for critical tasks  
- Dividing the work in the first week

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- Desensitization is not easy to quantify — building our own survey was necessary
and gave us the most relevant data  
- Even high-quality datasets may not align in time frames, which complicates
cross-comparison  
- Better communication and earlier feedback loops could have improved clarity
and saved time  
- There’s no ready-made dataset for social media post content — assessing how
much violent media is shared online requires manual effort or advanced API use,
which we weren’t equipped for  

## 🎯 Strategy vs. Board

### ✅ What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Designing and distributing the survey  
- Finding datasets to measure conflict and mobilization  

### ❌ What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Finding an existing dataset for emotional desensitization  
- Finding a dataset for conflict coverage through social media  
- Syncing time frames across all datasets  
- Getting every team member to contribute  

### ➕ Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Yes — building a custom survey from scratch  

### ➖ Or remove extra steps?

- We dropped the idea of collecting social media content due to lack of technical
skills and the difficulty of pulling consistent data across platforms

## 👤 Individual Retrospectives

**Name:** Sahar Omer  

- I’m proud of how I structured and scored the survey responses  
- I learned a lot about real-world data challenges, especially mismatched formats,
incomplete metadata, and the difficulty of finding existing datasets that truly
answer your research question  
- Next time, I’ll push earlier for clearer roles and stronger accountability
within the group

**Name:** Raghad Abdalrahim

- In this milestone, I learned what a dataset truly is and how to search for and
document useful data. At first, I expected to find one perfect dataset — but I
quickly realized that real-world data work often involves combining sources like
social media, protests, and trends.

- I also learned how to evaluate data quality and think about things like bias,
documentation, and reproducibility — all of which were new to me.

- Next time, I want to contribute earlier in the process and improve my technical
skills so I can help with scripts and data cleaning. This experience showed me
how powerful data can be when used thoughtfully to tell real stories — especially
ones that reflect our personal and shared struggles.

**Name:** Nagham al baba

- In Milestone 2, I learned how to search for relevant datasets using data tools
and how to clean and prepare data for analysis. I discovered that real-world data
is often messy and incomplete, and that combining multiple sources can be more
effective than relying on one.

This experience also taught me how to think critically about data quality and
bias. Next time, I want to get involved earlier in the process and improve my
technical skills.

## 🔴 Stop

- Assuming one dataset would answer everything
- Waiting too long to ask for help

## 🟢 Continue

- Exploring multiple data sources
- Collaborating with teammates

## 🟡 Start

- Taking initiative earlier
