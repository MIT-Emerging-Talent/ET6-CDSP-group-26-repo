# ðŸ“Œ Retrospective â€” Cross-Cultural Collaboration

## ðŸ”´ Stop Doing

- Expecting inactive teammates to take initiative without prompting.
- Assuming shared cultural understanding would automatically lead to better communication.
- Waiting for consensus before starting work.

## ðŸŸ¢ Continue Doing

- Respecting differences in communication and feedback.
- Documenting everything clearly so absent teammates can catch up if needed.
- Maintaining professionalism even when carrying most of the workload.

## ðŸŸ¡ Start Doing

- Setting non-negotiable timelines and consequences for missed deliverables.
- Using collaborative tools more actively to bridge gaps in participation.

## ðŸ“š Lessons Learned

- A smaller active group can move faster, but risks burnout without shared load.
