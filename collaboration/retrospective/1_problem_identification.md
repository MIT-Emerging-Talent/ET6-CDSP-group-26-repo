# ðŸ“Œ Retrospective â€” Problem Identification

## ðŸ”´ Stop Doing

- Over-discussing initial concepts without finalizing a direction early.

## ðŸŸ¢ Continue Doing

- Iterating on the research question until itâ€™s both measurable and meaningful.
- Grounding the problem in real-world relevance.
- Taking ownership when others canâ€™t contribute.

## ðŸŸ¡ Start Doing

- Locking in the problem statement by a set deadline, regardless of attendance.
- Assigning contingency ownership for each section.

## ðŸ“š Lessons Learned

- Clarity at the start prevents wasted time later.
- The problem statement should balance ambition with available skills/resources.
- Itâ€™s easier to align datasets and methods when the scope is finalized early.
