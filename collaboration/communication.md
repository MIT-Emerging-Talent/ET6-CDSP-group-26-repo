## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and
stubbornly getting nowhere. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 -> 30 min_: Try on your own  
2. _30 -> 60 min_: Ask your group for help  
3. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub

## Meeting Platform & Notes

- **Platform**: Zoom  
- **Frequency**: Weekly or as needed, based on project milestones  
- **Notes**: Shared after each meeting with key decisions and action items  

---

## Tools for Collaboration

- **Google Docs/Sheets**: For live collaboration, writing, and planning  
- **GitHub**: For version control, reviewing code, and managing pull requests  

---

  unsure
