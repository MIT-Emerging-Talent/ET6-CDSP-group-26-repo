# Constraints

## 1- Team Distribution & Availability

- Team members are spread across multiple time zones, limiting real-time coordination.  
- Meetings and collaboration require flexible scheduling to include everyone.  
- We accommodate different availability levels while maintaining progress.

## 2- Commitments & Workload Balance

- Members have other responsibilities (e.g. university, jobs, personal).  
- Time for this project is limited, so we aim to work efficiently.  
- If delays occur, we offer support and adjust responsibilities as needed.

## 3- Communication & Collaboration Tools

- We use GitHub, Google Drive, and other shared platforms.  
- Members may have different levels of access or experience.  
- Clear and simple communication is essential due to language differences.

## 4- Technical Learning & Deadline Pressure

- Skill levels vary; we encourage shared learning and peer support.  
- We hold short help sessions when needed (e.g. for GitHub).  
- Strict course deadlines require internal checkpoints and backup plans.
