# 📌 Retrospective

## 🔴 Stop Doing

- Relying on team members to complete documentation without setting clear
expectations or deadlines  
- Delaying or skipping weekly meetings  
- Waiting for a miracle that inactive teammates would suddenly get active  

## 🟢 Continue Doing

- Holding weekly check-ins to align tasks and clarify roles  
- Combining different types of data (event-based, behavioral, and survey-based)
- to get a more comprehensive view  
- Rethinking the same question until we find a way to measure it — not taking
- “no” for an answer  
- Supporting each other in areas where one teammate had more experience  

## 🟡 Start Doing

- Assigning backup owners for critical tasks  
- Dividing the work in the first week

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- Desensitization is not easy to quantify — building our own survey was necessary
and gave us the most relevant data  
- Even high-quality datasets may not align in time frames, which complicates
cross-comparison  
- Better communication and earlier feedback loops could have improved clarity
and saved time  
- There’s no ready-made dataset for social media post content — assessing how
much violent media is shared online requires manual effort or advanced API use,
which we weren’t equipped for  

## 🎯 Strategy vs. Board

### ✅ What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Designing and distributing the survey  
- Finding datasets to measure conflict and mobilization  

### ❌ What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Finding an existing dataset for emotional desensitization  
- Finding a dataset for conflict coverage through social media  
- Syncing time frames across all datasets  
- Getting every team member to contribute  

### ➕ Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Yes — building a custom survey from scratch  

### ➖ Or remove extra steps?

- We dropped the idea of collecting social media content due to lack of technical
skills and the difficulty of pulling consistent data across platforms

## 👤 Individual Retrospectives

**Name:** Sahar Omer  

- I’m proud of how I structured and scored the survey responses  
- I learned a lot about real-world data challenges, especially mismatched formats,
incomplete metadata, and the difficulty of finding existing datasets that truly
answer your research question  
- Next time, I’ll push earlier for clearer roles and stronger accountability
within the group
