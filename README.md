# Project Overview

As a team of Afghans and Gazans, we grew up in war conditions and witnessed
firsthand how constant exposure to graphic and violent content on social media
deeply affects emotional responses. This shared experience reflects a broader
global phenomenon, where people around the world are regularly exposed to
violent media â€” whether from conflict zones, natural disasters, or social
unrest.

Over time, this raises important questions:

- **Does repeated exposure to media violence lead to emotional desensitization?**
- **Or does it inspire greater empathy and social action?**

In this project, we aim to investigate the psychological and behavioral impacts
of violent media exposure using data science tools. By understanding these
patterns, we hope to contribute to discussions around digital media consumption,
public awareness, and mental well-being.
