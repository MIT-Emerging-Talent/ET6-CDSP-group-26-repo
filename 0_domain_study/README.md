## ðŸ“š Background Review of Domain

Media violence has been extensively studied for its effects on emotional and
behavioral outcomes. Our literature review highlights two key areas of interest:
the phenomenon of emotional desensitization, and the increasing engagement in
activism and civic participation

### ðŸ”‘ Keyword Definitions

To support clarity and shared understanding, we define the following key terms
used in our research:

- **Media Violence**: Any depiction of intentional harm or aggression through
various media formats, including news, films, television, social media, and
video games. This can include both fictional and real-world violence.

- **Desensitization**: A psychological process in which repeated exposure to
violent stimuli reduces emotional responsiveness, empathy, or concern toward
real-life suffering or violent events.

- **Empathy**: The ability to understand and share the feelings of another
person. In this context, we focus on emotional and cognitive empathy as they
relate to media influence and behavioral outcomes.

- **Civic Engagement**: Individual or collective actions designed to address
issues of public concern. This includes activities such as protesting,
petitioning, community organizing, voting, or digital advocacy.

- **Activism**: A form of civic engagement characterized by direct action to
promote, impede, or raise awareness of social, political, economic, or
environmental change.

- **Gen Z**: The demographic cohort born approximately between 1997 and 2012.
Gen Z is considered the first generation to grow up entirely in the digital
era, making them highly exposed to online content and media-based information.

### Media Violence â†’ Desensitization

Research shows that repeated exposure to violent content can lead to reduced emotional
responsiveness and empathy. Notable findings include:

- The [APA](https://www.apa.org/topics/video-games/violence-harmful-effects) highlights
that long-term exposure to violent media can lower emotional sensitivity and
increase aggression.
- A [PMC study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4522002/) demonstrates neural
desensitization in brain regions linked to empathy in individuals frequently exposed
to violent imagery.

These insights raise concerns about emotional fatigue or apathy in the face of
real-world violence and injustice.

### The Rise of Activism (Digital & Physical)

While much of the literature has examined emotional desensitization due to media
violence, we also observed a parallel trend worth exploring: the rise of both
digital and physical activism.

In recent years, large-scale movements have gained momentum through the power of
social media and repeated exposure to graphic or violent content. From protests
against racial injustice and police brutality to global campaigns for climate
action and human rights, people are increasingly mobilizing in response to the
violence they witness online and through other media.

- The [DNI Global Trends report](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/gt2040-home/gt2040-deeper-looks/future-of-public-activism)
finds that global activism is rising due to increased connectivity, education,
and public dissatisfaction.
- The [United Way NCA survey](https://unitedwaynca.org/blog/gen-z-activism-survey/)
shows that 32% of Gen Z are engaged in social justice efforts, with most
participating both online and in person.
- [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/06/29/americans-views-of-and-experiences-with-activism-on-social-media/)
reports that nearly half of U.S. social media users have taken part in some form
of digital activism in the past year.
