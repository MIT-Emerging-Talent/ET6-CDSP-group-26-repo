## ðŸ“š Background Review of Domain

Media violence has been widely studied for its impact on emotional and behavioral
responses. In reviewing the literature, we identified two major patterns worth exploring:
one focused on **emotional desensitization**, and another centered around the
**activism and civic engagement of Gen Z** â€” a generation deeply immersed in
violent content from a young age.

### ðŸ”‘ Keyword Definitions

To support clarity and shared understanding, we define the following key terms
used in our research:

- **Media Violence**: Any depiction of intentional harm or aggression through
various media formats, including news, films, television, social media, and
video games. This can include both fictional and real-world violence.

- **Desensitization**: A psychological process in which repeated exposure to
violent stimuli reduces emotional responsiveness, empathy, or concern toward
real-life suffering or violent events.

- **Empathy**: The ability to understand and share the feelings of another
person. In this context, we focus on emotional and cognitive empathy as they
relate to media influence and behavioral outcomes.

- **Civic Engagement**: Individual or collective actions designed to address
issues of public concern. This includes activities such as protesting,
petitioning, community organizing, voting, or digital advocacy.

- **Activism**: A form of civic engagement characterized by direct action to
promote, impede, or raise awareness of social, political, economic, or
environmental change.

- **Gen Z**: The demographic cohort born approximately between 1997 and 2012.
Gen Z is considered the first generation to grow up entirely in the digital
era, making them highly exposed to online content and media-based information.

### Media Violence â†’ Desensitization

Research shows that repeated exposure to violent content can lead to reduced emotional
responsiveness and empathy. Notable findings include:

The following findings are supported by reputable organizations and
peer-reviewed studies to ensure the credibility of the research.

- The [APA](https://www.apa.org/topics/video-games/violence-harmful-effects) highlights
that long-term exposure to violent media can lower emotional sensitivity and
increase aggression.
- A [PMC study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4522002/) demonstrates neural
desensitization in brain regions linked to empathy in individuals frequently exposed
to violent imagery.

These insights raise concerns about emotional fatigue or apathy in the face of
real-world violence and injustice.

### Our Focus: Gen Z and Activism

While we did not find studies that directly connect media violence to activism, we
chose to focus on **Gen Z** based on our own reasoning: this is the generation most
exposed to violent content â€” through history education, real-time news coverage of
conflicts and injustices, social media, violent entertainment, and gaming.

To explore our research question, we asked: *If Gen Z has grown up surrounded by
violent media, how are they responding to it?* Are they becoming more numb, or
more engaged?

The statistics and reports cited below come from well-established
institutions and provide a reliable basis for understanding Gen Z's behavior.

We found several studies that show Gen Z is increasingly active in civic and
political life:

- [**Ipsos Independence Day 2024 Report**](https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/Independence%20Day%20Infographic%20%2724%20v4%20%28Final%29_0.pdf)
: Gen Z is **61% more likely** to attend
a protest or rally than older generations.
- A [PMC study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3158614/) notes lower
trust in institutions among Gen Z, which may be driving them toward community-based
activism.
- The [Brennan Center](https://www.brennancenter.org/events/millennials-gen-z-and-civic-engagement)
emphasizes how Gen Z uses digital tools to organize and engage in civic discourse.
- The [PPIC](https://www.ppic.org/blog/video-are-younger-generations-committing-less-crime/)
reports that Gen Z is committing fewer violent crimes, possibly channeling their
energy into activism instead.

These findings don't make a direct causal connection â€” but they support our decision
to study **Gen Zâ€™s civic behavior** as a way to explore the potential social effects
of growing up with constant exposure to media violence.
